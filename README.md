# TV-Script-Generation
This is my 3rd project as a part of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Program

In this project, I learnt to generate my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. Used part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. 
The Neural Network developed will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

The data is present in /data/Seinfeld_Scripts.txt
